    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's finally dive into the nitty-gritty and see how we can code with Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the Anthropic Claude API, focusing on how to leverage both standard chat capabilities and advanced reasoning features. We'll examine how to structure effective system prompts and create applications that utilize the model's extended thinking capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Set up and configure the Anthropic Claude API\n",
    "- Create tailored system prompts for specific use cases\n",
    "- Compare standard responses with reasoning-enhanced outputs\n",
    "- Analyze the \"thinking\" process in reasoning models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "Take the code we have used in this lecture and see if you can beat my overall score. Let's turn this into a friendly competition for all those tackling this project and compare the results you get :D\n",
    "\n",
    "Place your submission in the community-contributions folder by creating a folder with your name in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version History\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find any updates I have made to the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that some of the code may be different to what you have seen in the lectures as there may be bug fixes or improvements but the general objective of the notebook will remain the same.\n",

Professionalism (1-10):\\nThe email maintains a professional tone throughout, using appropriate language and formatting. It has a clear subject line, greeting, and sign-off. The representative identifies themselves as a customer service representative and provides contact information. The language is respectful and business-appropriate. There are no spelling or grammatical errors. The structure is organized and follows standard business email format.\\nScore: 9/10 - The email is highly professional with appropriate structure, tone, and language.\\n\\n2. Empathy (1-10):\\nThe response starts with an acknowledgment of the issue and a sincere apology. The representative validates the customer\\'s frustration and demonstrates understanding of their concerns. The phrase \"I understand your frustration\" directly addresses the emotional aspect of the complaint. The representative takes responsibility for the error rather than deflecting blame. The addition of a discount code shows they\\'re going beyond mere acknowledgment to actually make amends.\\nScore: 8/10 - The response shows genuine empathy through acknowledgment, validation, and making amends.\\n\\n3. Problem Resolution (1-10):\\nThe email clearly states that a full refund is being processed immediately with a timeline for when it will be reflected in the customer\\'s account. The representative has taken ownership of the issue by reviewing the account and confirming the discrepancy. They offer a compensation in the form of a discount code. They also address the prevention of future issues by mentioning the billing team\\'s review of the pricing system. They provide a specific follow-up date and contact information for further questions.\\nScore: 9/10 - The response offers immediate resolution with clear timelines and preventative measures.\\n\\n4. Clarity (1-10):\\nThe email is clear and concise, avoiding technical jargon. It clearly outlines the steps being taken (refund processing), the timeline (3-5 business days), and additional compensation (10% discount). The instructions for using the discount code are straightforward. The next steps are clearly outlined, including when to follow up if the refund hasn\\'t been received. However, there are placeholders for [date] and [contact information] which would need to be filled in with specific details in the actual email.\\nScore: 8/10 - The message is clear and informative, though actual contact details need to be inserted.\\n\\n5. Brand Representation (1-10):\\nThe response represents the brand positively by showing commitment to customer satisfaction and billing accuracy. The quick acknowledgment and resolution demonstrate customer-centric values. The additional discount shows generosity and a desire to maintain the customer relationship. The mention of system reviews shows commitment to improvement. The overall tone projects reliability and trustworthiness.\\nScore: 9/10 - The response positively represents the brand through customer-centricity and commitment to improvement.\\n\\nTotal score calculation:\\nIf I simply add up the scores: 9 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 43/50\\nHowever, the prompt asks for a score out of 100, so converting to a 100-point scale: 43/50 × 100 = 86/100\\n\\nSo the TOTAL SCORE would be 86/100.\\n\\nActually, let me double-check if there\\'s another way the scoring should be calculated based on the prompt. The prompt asks to \"Rate each category with ONE LINE explanation\" and then lists 5 categories with scores out of 10. Then it asks for a TOTAL SCORE out of 100. \\n\\nSince 5 categories with a maximum of 10 points each would naturally sum to 50, I believe the intention is to convert this to a 100-point scale by doubling, which gives us 86/100. This seems like the most logical interpretation.', type='thinking'), TextBlock(citations=None, text=\"# Evaluation of Customer Service Email Response\\n\\n1.
